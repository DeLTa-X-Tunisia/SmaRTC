# SmaRTC - A WebRTC-based Communication Platform

SmaRTC is a robust, scalable, and secure platform for real-time communication, built on the power of WebRTC. It provides a complete backend infrastructure, including signaling, user authentication, and session management, enabling developers to build sophisticated video and audio communication applications.

The platform is designed with a microservices architecture and is fully containerized with Docker, ensuring high availability, scalability, and ease of deployment.

## Key Features

- **WebRTC Signaling**: High-performance signaling server for establishing peer-to-peer connections.
- **User Authentication**: Secure, token-based authentication (JWT) with support for user roles and permissions.
- **Session Management**: RESTful API for creating, managing, and participating in communication sessions.
- **STUN/TURN Server**: Integrated Coturn server for NAT traversal.
- **Containerized Deployment**: Fully containerized with Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose for easy setup and deployment.
- **Extensible SDKs**: Client-side SDKs for JavaScript, C#, and Swift to accelerate application development.
